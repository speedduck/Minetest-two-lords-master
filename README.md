Minetest-two-lords-master
=======================

This mod was inspired by the Lord of the Test minetest game. It includes five different mob 'races' and one boss. These are elves, orcs, dwarves, goblins, and wraiths with Sauron as a 12000 HP boss. There is a bunch of new armor and powerful weapons, called rings of power. These rings are basically an all purpose tool and can be used to mine, chop, dig, and kill. This mod depends on Pilzadams simple mobs and animal mobs, as well as inventory_plus. It's also probably a good idea to install a crafting guide mod until you are comfortable with the crafting recipes of this mod.
